    "text": "Hello! Iâ€™m a developer/artist from NYC with a focus on programing interaction and graphics. I worked as the lead developer for the first VR restaurant in the city creating custom software, optimizing 3D models, writing custom shaders and working with hand-tracking sensors in a multiplayer setup. Recently I've been working as a freelance web developer as well as on a browser based open world video chatting platform centered around artistry, live performance and inclusion called Antibody Club. I also love audio synthesis, 3D modeling, and creative coding."
